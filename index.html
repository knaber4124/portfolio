                <p>My name is Keith Naber and thank you for visiting my portfolio page which will give you an idea of
                    who I am, show you a quick simpling of the work I have done during my coding bootcamp experience and
                    allow you to send me feedback on everything you see here.</p>
                <p>For most of my professional life I have been in sales and customer service roles. Over the past few
                    years, I have been increasingly looking for a new challenge and way to better the lives of my
                    family. While doing some soul searching one day, I stumbled upon an ad for the UNH Coding Bootcamp
                    and was quite intrigue. In college I had taken a very rudimentary course on HTML,CSS, and overall
                    web design and enjoyed myself quite a bit. After doing some additional research, I decided that this
                    was the exact career change that I was looking for and signed up the bootcamp.</p>
                <p>The bootcamp experience is a very challenging and rewarding one. The need to continually reseach and
                    learn is something that I enjoy a great deal as it requires me to continually better and challenge
                    myself. While I enjoy the individual work, the group projects are by far the most rewarding
                    activites that we have done. These projects not only allow you to challenge yourself on more complex
                    problems but also allows you to work closely with other members of the class and get the best work
                    out of everyone.</p>
                <p>Personally, I am a very outgoing person who loves to challenge myself and others around me. It is my
                    firm belief that when we combine individual drive and determination with group dynamics and
                    accountability we are able to achieve incredible things. I am enjoy history, politics, most sports
                    and spending time with my family. I hope that you enjoy my portfolio and look forward to hearing
                    your feedback.</p>
